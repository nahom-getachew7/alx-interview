# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Task 0: Prime Game
    Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game.

    They play x rounds of the game, where n may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who the winner of each game is.

    Prototype: def isWinner(x, nums)
    where x is the number of rounds and nums is an array of n
    Return: name of the player that won the most rounds
    If the winner cannot be determined, return None
    You can assume n and x will not be larger than 10000
    You cannot import any packages in this task
    Example:

    x = 3, nums = [4, 5, 1]
    First round: 4

    Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3
    Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1
    Ben wins because there are no prime numbers left for Maria to choose
    Second round: 5

    Maria picks 2 and removes 2, 4, leaving 1, 3, 5
    Ben picks 3 and removes 3, leaving 1, 5
    Maria picks 5 and removes 5, leaving 1
    Maria wins because there are no prime numbers left for Ben to choose
    Third round: 1

    Ben wins because there are no prime numbers for Maria to choose
    Result: Ben has the most wins
